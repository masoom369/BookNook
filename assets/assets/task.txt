Objectives of the project

The Objective of this program is to give a sample project to work on real life projects.
These applications help you build a larger more robust application.
The objective is not to teach you the concepts but to provide you with a real life
scenario and help you create applications using the tools.
You can revise them before you start with the project.
It is very essential that a student has a clear understanding of the subject.
Kindly get back to eProjects Team, in case of any doubts regarding the application or its
objectives.
